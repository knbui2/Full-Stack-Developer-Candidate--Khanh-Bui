This is a build your own pizza website that I designed specifically customers who want to customize their own pizzas.

The website includes two index.html pages, one for home page and one for build your own pizza page.
I used different fonts from googlefonts and some icons from fontawesome. 
Some images online were included as well to make the page not so boring to the eyes.

For the build your own page, I decided to include a variety of toppings and other options to customize the pizza which can also 
be seen in the cart after users finished designing it.
The total cost will automatically calculated at the very end.

In order to deploy this website, I use GitHub itself to deploy my repository by connect it to the main branch then deploy it.
